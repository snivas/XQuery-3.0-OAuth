Hello,

This repository contains an OAuth implementation written in XQuery 3.0. 
It is actually derived from https://github.com/grtjn/XQuery-OAuth which 
relies on several MarkLogic extensions at the moment.

Also, there's no native implementation of the HMAC-SHA1 signing algorithm
at the moment, so this script relies on a web service to compute that.

If you want to setup the web service yourself, contact 
Norman Walsh (https://github.com/ndw) who started this  project.

Docs, etc. to follow. (In the fullness of time, like the next ice age,
probably. If you have questions, feel free to ask.)


Currently, this contains just the copy of the master OAuth project. No modifications were done. I am yet to implement :)
